  ## Installation
   click on the "Terminal" menu located in the top menu bar.From the drop-down menu that appears, select "New Terminal" to open a new terminal window at the bottom of the VS Code interface. The terminal should now be ready for use.Next, **ensure that you are in the directory where the "index.js" file is located**. You can do this by navigating to the correct directory using the "cd" command in the terminal. For example, if your "index.js" file is located in a folder called "my_project," you would type the following command and press Enter: cd path/to/your/project/my_projectReplace "path/to/your/project/my_project" with the actual path to your project's directory.Once you are in the correct directory, type the following command in the terminal and press Enter: **"npm i"** This command is a shorthand for "npm install," which will trigger the installation of all the required modules and dependencies specified in the "package.json" file, which should be present in the same directory as the "index.js" file. npm will now start installing the necessary modules. You'll see progress information in the terminal as the installation proceeds. After the installation process is complete, you should see a new folder named "node_modules" in your project directory. This folder contains the installed modules that your project needs to run correctly.
